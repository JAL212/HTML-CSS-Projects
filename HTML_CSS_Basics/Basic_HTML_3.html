			<h2>Rescuing Teddy</h2>
			<p>Adding Test Paragraph</p>
			<p>Teddy was found as a stray in Atlanta, GA by an animla rescue organization. After some care and recovery - several procedures to neuter, to remove an eye, and to a cyst from his remaining eye, Teddy was finally ready for adoption. We were so happy to be chosen as Teddy's new family, and now - at somewhere betweenn 8 and 10 years old - he is living his best life in the mountains of North Carolina</p>
			<p>Teddy's favorite things are: sleeping all day, very short walks, and sleeping all day.</p>
