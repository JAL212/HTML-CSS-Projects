				<summary>Patriots Finally Address the Offense</summary>
				<p>
					The New England Patriots came into the 2024 NFL Draft with one clear objective: fix the offense. With seven of their eight selections coming on the offensive side of the ball, they seemed to have addressed their greatest need. As acting GM Eliot Wolf put it, the Patriots plan to be a "draft and develop team" going forward. They've done the drafting; time will tell if the can do the developing.<br>
					<br>
					With high upside picks like Drake Maye and Javon Baker, along with safer picks like Ja'lynn Polk and Caedan Wallace, the Patriots had a balanced (if not boring) draft...beyond their Drake Maye pick.<br>
